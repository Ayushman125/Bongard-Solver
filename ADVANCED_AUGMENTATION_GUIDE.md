## 📊 Quality Assessment Framework

### Multi-Dimensional Quality Metrics

1. **Mask Completeness** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Measures connectivity and coherence of generated masks
   - Identifies fragmented or incomplete segmentations

2. **Boundary Smoothness** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Evaluates contour quality and edge consistency
   - Prevents jagged or artificial-looking boundaries

3. **Geometric Consistency** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Validates alignment between mask edges and image features
   - Ensures masks respect actual object boundaries

4. **Spatial Distribution** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Measures uniform distribution across image quadrants
   - Prevents clustering or bias in spatial coverage

5. **Feature Diversity** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Quantifies variety in geometric and statistical properties
   - Encourages diverse mask characteristics for robust learning

### Adaptive Threshold Learning
- **Historical Analysis**: Learns optimal thresholds from performance data
- **Percentile-Based Adaptation**: Uses 25th percentile as adaptive lower bound
- **Smoothed Updates**: Prevents threshold instability through exponential smoothing

# Access enhanced samples with quality scores
samples = result['samples']
metadata = result['metadata']

print(f"Generated {len(samples)} high-quality samples")
print(f"Average quality: {metadata['average_quality']:.3f}")
print(f"Quality range: {metadata['min_quality']:.3f} - {metadata['max_quality']:.3f}")
